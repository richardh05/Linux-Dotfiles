## Yapping
I've been on and off Linux for a few years, mostly sticking to Ubuntu-based distros. As a summer project for 2024, I decided to dive into Arch Linux with a minimal window manager to create a personalised operating system for myself. I use these files on my main laptop and have mostly settled on my setup. Creating this helped teach me about packages (managers), desktop environments, common CLI applications, file versioning and much more.
